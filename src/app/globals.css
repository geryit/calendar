/**
 * Global CSS Styles
 *
 * This file is a global stylesheet for the application. It integrates Tailwind CSS by
 * importing its layers: base, components, and utilities.
 *
 * Tailwind CSS Layers:
 * 1. @tailwind base: Imports Tailwind's base styles. These are low-level, pre-designed
 *    styles like normalize.css or reset.css that provide a consistent styling baseline
 *    across browsers. They include default styles for standard HTML elements.
 *
 * 2. @tailwind components: Imports the component classes defined in your Tailwind
 *    configuration. This layer is where you define your own custom components or extend
 *    Tailwind's default components.
 *
 * 3. @tailwind utilities: Imports Tailwind's utility classes. These are a comprehensive
 *    set of CSS classes for styling elements directly in your markup. They cover a wide
 *    range of CSS properties and provide a high degree of design flexibility.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Include this file in the main entry point of your application to make Tailwind CSS
 * styles available across your entire app.
 *
 * Example:
 * In a React application, you might import this file in your `index.js` or `App.js` file:
 * `import './app/globals.css';`
 *
 * Note:
 * - Ensure that Tailwind CSS is properly configured in your project, including its installation
 *   and configuration in your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files.
 * - This file should be the first CSS file imported in your project to lay down the foundation
 *   of global styles on which you can build component-specific styles.
