/**
 * PostCSS Configuration
 *
 * This configuration file is for PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
 * The configuration includes two main plugins: Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.
 *
 * Plugins:
 * 1. tailwindcss: Integrates Tailwind CSS into the build process. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS
 *    framework that allows for rapid UI development. It does not require any specific configuration
 *    object for basic usage, thus the empty object (`{}`) is passed.
 *
 * 2. autoprefixer: Adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from "Can I Use". It is used to
 *    increase compatibility of the CSS across different browsers. Like Tailwind CSS, it requires no
 *    specific configuration for basic usage, so an empty object is provided.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This configuration is used by PostCSS during the build process. Ensure that PostCSS is set up in your
 * build tool (like Webpack, Parcel, or others). The plugins in this configuration will be automatically
 * applied to your CSS.
 *
 * Example:
 * The typical usage scenario involves writing Tailwind classes in your CSS, which will be processed by
 * Tailwind CSS plugin, and then autoprefixer will add necessary vendor prefixes to the final CSS.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Make sure to install `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` via npm or yarn before using this configuration.
 * - You may customize the behavior of each plugin by providing specific configuration options in place of
 *   the empty objects (`{}`).
